This can be achieved with a few steps:

1. Activate the “code” command from VScode itself: CMD + SHIFT + P or Ctrl + SHIFT + P
2. Type in code and select the option “`install "code" command in PATH`"
3. When you are in the directory of the files you want to open in VS Code, type ”`code .`" or ”`code -n .`" 
4. If nothing happens you will have to quit or restart the current Terminal session running.
