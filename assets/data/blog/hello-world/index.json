The main aim is to write a article the way i would want to read it if i ever found something online.</p>\n<p>I am always very passionate about how the things are created and would like to know how they always worked behind the screen that curiosity led me into learning programming although. after college got my first web development job where i worked mostly on wordpress websites where i dealt in both world of frontend as well as backend. My intrest currently lies in working on frontend development in building scalable responsive websites that may be build with regular html css or Vue JS. I also have some experience in building premium wordpress themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>Taking some design inspiration from a theme built for another language i designed this website from scracth I have used Gridsome for building this website as i was getting deep into Vue.js and thought i needed to upgrade from my previous blog design which was based on 11ty. I particularly liked the graphQL layer of gridsome for querying data.</p>\n","date":"February 23, 2022","tags":[]}},"context":{}}
