Rowling's fantasy novel series. However, news that would surprise even the most ardent Potterhead recently came to light when it was revealed Draco Malfoy had only 31 minutes of screen-time in all eight Harry Potter films.</p>\n<p>The mind-blowing revelation was unearthed following a recent viral tweet, and a quick scan of the official Harry Potter IMDB page confirms that Tom Felton's character does indeed have just over half an hour of screen-time throughout all 19 hours and 40 minutes of the eight films.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he fact Draco Malfoy was only in 31 minutes throughout the WHOLE of the Harry Potter franchise (19 hrs &#x26; 40 mins) jus doesnâ€™t sit right with me,\" one Twitter user commented.</p>\n<p>As Tyla reports, Malfoy's longest appearance can be enjoyed in Harry Potter &#x26; the Half Blood Prince, during which the Slytherin bad boy appears for a grand total of eight minutes. In contrast, the character's shortest amount of screen-time sits at one minute and 15 seconds in the fifth instalment of the Potter franchise, Order Of The Phoenix.</p>\n<p>However, lack of screen-time for supporting characters is not uncommon throughout the Potter adaptations. The menacing Lord Voldemort, for instance, appears for a total of 37 minutes and 15 seconds, while fan-favourite Rubeus Hagrid stuck around for just over 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>Predictably, the film's core cast were awarded a far greater amount of on-screen exposure throughout all eight films, with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger appearing for around three and a half hours each, and the main man himself, Harry Potter, enjoyed almost nine hours of screen-time in total, Tyla reports.</p>\n","date":"October 16, 2020","tags":[]}},"context":{}}
